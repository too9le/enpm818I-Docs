This section provides the sources of possible RF interference with the components of the \ThisSys in different RF bands.
These sources may be generated internally and externally to the \ThisSys. Interfering signals coupling to the transmitted signals lower the \SNR for the audience radio receivers which reduces range. Transmission of signals outside the presumed signal bandwidth may cause inference with other legitimate communication systems. Interference influences the \ThisSys component layout, cabling, filtering, and antenna positioning.
The RF bands that the system provides are:
\begin{description}
	\item[AM] The AM radio broadcast band of the \ThisSys, \S~\ref{loc:ExtIF_Interference_AM}
	\item[SW] The short wave radio broadcast band of the \ThisSys, \S~\ref{loc:ExtIF_Interference_SW}
	\item[FM] The FM radio broadcast band of the \ThisSys, \S~\ref{loc:ExtIF_Interference_FM}
	\item[VHF] The VHF TV broadcast band of the \ThisSys, \S~\ref{loc:ExtIF_Interference_VHF}
	\item[UHF] The UHF TV and Cellular broadcast band of the \ThisSys, \S~\ref{loc:ExtIF_Interference_UHF}
