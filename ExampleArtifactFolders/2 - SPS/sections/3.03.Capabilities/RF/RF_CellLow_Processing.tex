The \ThisSys \ThisSegment \CellLow capability is divided into the following specification groups:
\begin{description}
	\item[Output processing] provides the \CellLow broadcast output capability, \S~\ref{loc:RF_CellLow_Output}.
	\item[Input processing]  provides the \CellLow broadcast input  capability, \S~\ref{loc:RF_CellLow_Input}.
\end{description}
An overview the processing performed by these groups is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CellLow_RF_Processing}.
