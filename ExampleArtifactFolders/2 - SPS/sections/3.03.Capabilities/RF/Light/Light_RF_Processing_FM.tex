The \ThisSegment \FM capability is divided into two segments:
\begin{description}
	\item[FM RF Transmission Processing] provides the \FM broadcast output capability.%, \S~\ref{loc:RF_FM_Output}.
	\item[FM RF Receive Processing]  provides the \FM broadcast input  capability required for the Rebroadcasting capability.%, \S~\ref{loc:RF_FM_Input}.
\end{description}
%An overview the processing performed by these groups is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:FM_RF_Processing}.
