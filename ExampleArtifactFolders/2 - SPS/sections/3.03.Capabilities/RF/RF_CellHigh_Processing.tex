The \ThisSys \ThisSegment \CellHigh capability is divided into the following specification groups:
\begin{description}
	\item[Output processing] provides the \CellHigh broadcast output capability, \S~\ref{loc:RF_CellHigh_Output}.
	\item[Input processing]  provides the \CellHigh broadcast input  capability, \S~\ref{loc:RF_CellHigh_Input}.
\end{description}
An overview the processing performed by these groups is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CellHigh_RF_Processing}.
