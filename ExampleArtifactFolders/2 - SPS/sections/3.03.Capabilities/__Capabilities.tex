This section defines the capability segments for the \ThisSys.
The segment design is structured to meet the requirements as specified in~\cite{ref__BDP_FOS_CDD}.
Each segment provides a subset of the overall capabilities for the \ThisSys segments.
These segments are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DFD-0}, are summarized below, and are more fully specified in the following subsections.

	\label{fig:DFD-0}
\end{figure}
 
The capability requirements for these segments are described in more detail in the following sections:
\begin{description}
	\item[Control Processing] handles the \HMI interface to the operator and provides overall control and configuration to the \ThisSys, \S~\ref{loc:Capability_Control}.
	\item[Media Processing] receives digital media content that is stored and later directed to the Waveform Processing for dissemination, \S~\ref{loc:Capability_Media}.
	\item[Waveform Processing] receives digital media streams, converts the stream to the proper transmission format, modulates the stream on an \RF carrier signal, and converts the \RF signal into the analog \RF Broadcast Pre-Amp Data output, \S~\ref{loc:Capability_Waveform}.
	\item[RF Processing] provides amplification and filtering for outbound \RF signals to be broadcast to the target audience and necessary filtering and \LNA services for inbound \RF signals, \S~\ref{loc:Capability_RFProcessing}.
