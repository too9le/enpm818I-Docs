The \ThisSys \ThisSegment \FM capability is divided into the following specification groups:
\begin{description}
	\item[Receive processing] provides the \FM receive waveform processing capability.
	%\item[Output processing] provides the \FM broadcast output waveform processing capability, \S~\ref{loc:Waveform_FM_Output}.
	%\item[Input processing]  provides the \FM broadcast input waveform processing  capability, \S~\ref{loc:Waveform_FM_Input}.
	\item[Transmission processing] provides the \FM broadcast transmission waveform processing capability. This processing supports both the \FM Radio Broadcast and \FM Radio Broadcast with \RDS/\RBDS sub-modes. The difference between the two sub-modes is managed by two distinct Transmission Input Processing functions because of the additional \RDS/\RBDS information. For the case of rebroadcasting a received \FM Rebroadcast, a third distinct Transmission Input Processing function is documented.
	\item[\VSWR processing] provides the \FM broadcast \VSWR processing capability.
\end{description}
An overview of the processing performed by these groups is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:FM_Waveform_Processing}.
