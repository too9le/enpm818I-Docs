	\item This processing is enabled when the input selects the sub-mode, Analog Television (\ATV) in this case.
	\item The inputs will supply the \ATV Video Standard, \RF carrier frequency, and modulation bandwidth information needed to produce the modulated \RF waveform.
	\item The audio stream will be converted into digital samples (discrete-time analytic signal) that represent the original monaural analog audio signal.
	\item The \MPEG video stream will be converted to separate luma and chroma interlaced video signals made up of digital sample streams that represent (discrete-time analytic signals) the two analog video signals.
	\item The luma/chroma signals are YIQ format for \NTSC, YU’V for \PAL, and YDbDr for both \SECAM and \PAL-N.
