%This section lists the states, sub-states, modes, and sub-modes that are provided by the system.
%While these terms can be construed in many ways, for this document, the following meanings are used:
%\begin{description}
	%\item[States] are the basic configurations of the system.
	%\item[Sub-states] are the effective state of being for the system.
	%\item[Modes] are the basic functions to be performed by the system when in a given state and/or sub-state.
	%\item[Sub-modes] if listed, are specific function modifications to be performed by the system within the given mode/function.
%\end{description}

A summary of the modes for each sub-state and state is provided in Table~\ref{tab:Medium-StatesAndModes} below.
%~\ref{tab:StatesAndModes-Light}, ~\ref{tab:StatesAndModes-Medium}, and ~\ref{tab:StatesAndModes-Heavy}
The table provides a quick summary. A check mark (\cmark) designates a system capability, while an x mark (\xmark) designates an inability.
See the specifications in the following sections for formal statement of the states and modes requirements, and accompanying notes that provide further clarification on the meanings of the states, sub-states, and modes.

\subsubsection{States}
\RequirementNumberAM{subsection}{3.1.2}
\renewcommand{\RqtNumberBase}{\getcurrentref{subsubsection}}

This section provides the system states.
System states are the basic states for the system.

\subsubsection{Sub-States}
\RequirementNumberAM{subsubsection}{3.1.2.1}
\label{loc:medium_substates}

This section provides the system sub-states.
System sub-states are defined by the operational configuration.
The sub-states are defined for each system configuration state.

\subsubsection{Modes}
\RequirementNumberAM{subsection}{3.1.2}
\label{loc:medium_modes}

This section provides the system modes.
System modes are the top-level functions to be performed by the system.
The modes are by system states but may be qualified further by the sub-states.
The modes describe the capabilities irrespective of the temporal processing constraints.

\subsubsection{Sub-Modes}
\RequirementNumberAM{subsubsection}{3.1.2.1}
\label{loc:medium_submodes}

This section provides the system sub-modes.
System sub-modes, if listed, are the specific functions to be performed by the system.
The sub-modes are defined for each system mode.
