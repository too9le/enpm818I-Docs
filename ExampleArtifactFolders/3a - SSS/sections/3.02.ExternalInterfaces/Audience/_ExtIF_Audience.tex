This section provides the specifications for the equipment that provide interfaces between the \ThisSys and the target audience.

The equipment to which the system provides human interfaces are:
\begin{description}
	\item[Omnidirectional Antenna] delivers the transmission to a target audience in all directions from the transmitting source, \S~\ref{loc:ExtIF_Omni_Antenna}.
	\item[Directional Antenna] delivers the transmission to a target audience in a directional pattern from the transmitting source, \S~\ref{loc:ExtIF_Directional_Antenna}.
\end{description}
