	\item This processing is enabled when the input selects the sub-mode, \FM or \FM with \RDS.
	\item The inputs will supply the \RF carrier frequency and frequency deviation information needed to extract the reflected power from the Received \RF Data Input.
	\item A digitally sampled signal that represents the reflected \RF signal is generated which is controlled by the carrier frequency and modulation bandwidth inputs.

	\item The integration time from the control inputs determines number of samples used in the calculations and the update rate.
	\item Low reflected power or high \VSWR measurements will generate the fault notifications which will be used to disable the \RF Broadcast Output. A low reflected power measurement while transmitting would indicate that no \RF power is being transmitted.
