% #8 is Notes; listed as enumeration \item ...
{
	\item The Band-Pass Filter (\BPF) will filter out signals outside of the commercial \FM broadcasting band of 87 â€“ 108 \MHz.
	\item The Low-Noise Amplifier (\LNA) will amplify the \FM bandwidth input signal(s) by greater than 40\dB with a Noise Figure less than 2 \dB and a maximum output power less than 0 \dBm.
	\item The Antenna will receive the radiated \RF signals in the \FM band and should be a directional antenna for maximum performance. The antenna \HAAT is dependent on the location of the transmitter, but higher is better to reduce signal fading.
