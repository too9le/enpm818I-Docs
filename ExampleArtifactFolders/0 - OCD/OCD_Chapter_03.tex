\chapter{Current system or situation}
\label{chap:Current System or Situation}
\input{DIDINFO_Snippets/OCD/OCD_3.0_DIDINFO.tex}

This chapter describes the capabilities and needs for the \system. This \system aims to solve the complicated world of specialty coffee.
New users may find themselves overwhelmed by the complexity of Espresso. The \system focuses on usabilty to allow the user to input factors
like coffe weight and a desired brew ratio and allow the machine to automate the process. This system also monitors the Rancillio Silvia's 
current state, measuring water level to protect the system from running out of water and potentially damaging the boiler. At this time the system
is designed as a protype to prove out capabilities. The focus of this design is time to market with the most user features.  


\section{Background, objectives, and scope}
\label{sec:Background, Objectives, and Scope}
\input{DIDINFO_Snippets/OCD/OCD_3.1_DIDINFO.tex}

This system is designed to meet the criteria of ENPM818I. This course focuses on embedded software design and servers to document the process of
developing an embedded system. 

The \system aims to simplify the complicated process of brewing espresso for optimal user enjoyment. This system integrates with the existing
Rancillio Silvia espresso machine and must be safe and easy for users.
