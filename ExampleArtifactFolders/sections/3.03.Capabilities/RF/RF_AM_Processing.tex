The \ThisSys \ThisSegment capability is divided into the following specification groups:
\begin{description}
	\item[Output processing] provides the \AM broadcast output capability, \S~\ref{loc:RF_AM_Output}.
	\item[Input processing]  provides the \AM broadcast input  capability, \S~\ref{loc:RF_AM_Input}.
\end{description}
An overview the processing performed by these groups is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:AM_RF_Processing}.
