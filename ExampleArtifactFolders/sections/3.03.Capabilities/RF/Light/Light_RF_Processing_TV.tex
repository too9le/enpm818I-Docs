The \RF Transmission Processing does not distinguish between \ATV and \DTV \RF signals, however, due to the wide range of the frequency bands, processing is segmented into the following transmission bands:
\begin{description}
	\item[\TVVHFLow] provides the \TVVHFLow broadcast output and related \RF processing.%, \S~\ref{loc:RF_FM_Output}.
	\item[\TVVHFHigh] provides the \TVVHFHigh broadcast output and related \RF processing.%, \S~\ref{loc:RF_FM_Input}.
	\item[\TVUHF] provides the \TVUHF broadcast output and related \RF processing.
\end{description}

An overview the processing performed by these groups is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Light_RF_Processing_TV_Transmission}.
