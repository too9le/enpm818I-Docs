The individual waveform processing elements are determined by the \ThisSys variant and controlled by the current States, Sub-States, Modes, and Sub-Modes of the system.
The \ThisSys Waveform Processing capability is segmented into the following specification groups:
\begin{description}
	\item[\AM]        provides the \AM                input and output waveform processing, \S~\ref{lloc:Waveform_Processing_AM}.
	\item[\SW]        provides the \SW                input and output waveform processing, \S~\ref{lloc:Waveform_Processing_SW}.
	\item[\FM]        provides the \FM                input and output waveform processing, \S~\ref{lloc:Waveform_Processing_FM}.
	\item[\ATV]  			provides the \ATV         			input and output waveform processing, \S~\ref{lloc:Waveform_Processing_ATV}.
	\item[\DTV] 			provides the \DTV        				input and output waveform processing, \S~\ref{lloc:Waveform_Processing_DTV}.
	%\item[\TVVHFLow]  provides the \TVVHFLow          input and output waveform processing, \S~\ref{lloc:Waveform_Processing_TVVHFLow}.
	%\item[\TVVHFHigh] provides the \TVVHFHigh         input and output waveform processing, \S~\ref{lloc:Waveform_Processing_TVVHFHigh}.
	%\item[\TVUHF]     provides the \TVUHF             input and output waveform processing, \S~\ref{lloc:Waveform_Processing_TVUHF}.
	%\item[\CellLow]   provides the low-band cellular  input and output waveform, \S~\ref{lloc:Waveform_Processing_CellLow}.
	%\item[\CellHigh]  provides the high-band cellular input and output waveform, \S~\ref{lloc:Waveform_Processing_CellHigh}.
