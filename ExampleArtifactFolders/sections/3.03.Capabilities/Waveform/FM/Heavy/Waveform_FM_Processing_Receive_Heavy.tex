	\item This processing is enabled when the input selects the sub-mode, \FM Rebroadcast in this case.
	\item The Control Inputs supply the \RF carrier frequency, frequency deviation (bandwidth) needed to demodulate and filter the received \FM signal.
	\item The filtering is required to remove any received adjacent channels from the designated bandwidth.
