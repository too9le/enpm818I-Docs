The \ThisSys \ThisSegment \AM capability is divided into the following specification groups:
\begin{description}
	%\item[Output processing] provides the \AM broadcast output waveform processing capability, \S~\ref{loc:Waveform_AM_Output}.
	%\item[Input processing]  provides the \AM broadcast input waveform processing  capability, \S~\ref{loc:Waveform_AM_Input}.
	\item[Transmission processing] provides the \AM broadcast output waveform processing capability.%, \S~\ref{loc:Waveform_AM_Transmission}.
	\item[VSWR processing]  provides the \AM broadcast VSWR processing capability.%, \S~\ref{loc:Waveform_AM_VSWR}.
\end{description}
An overview of the processing performed by these groups is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:AM_Waveform_Processing}.
