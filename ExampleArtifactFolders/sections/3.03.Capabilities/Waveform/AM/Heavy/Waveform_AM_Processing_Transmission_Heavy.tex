{
	\item This processing is enabled when the Waveform Control Input selects the sub-mode, Amplitude Modulation (\AM) in this case.
	\item The audio information is obtained by decoding the \MPEGTS data stream, extracting the audio stream, and transforming it into a discrete-time digital representation (analytic signal) of the original analog audio signal.
	\item The audio analytic signal is amplitude modulated on the \RF carrier to create the Audio Data stream output for the Transmission Output Processing.
	\item The Waveform Control Input supplies the \RF carrier frequency, modulation bandwidth, and modulation index information needed to produce the audio amplitude modulated \RF waveform.
