The multi-channel, maximum broadcasting range, and \SWaP requirements vastly differ among the \ThisSys variants, necessitating unique \RF processing to adequately produce the radiated \RF power that satisfies these requirements. For this reason, the \ThisSys \RF Processing capability is segmented into the following specification groups:

\begin{description}
	\item[BDP-Light] \RF Processing, \S~\ref{loc:BDP-Light_RF_Processing}.
	%\item[BDP-Medium] \RF Processing, \S~\ref{loc:BDP-Medium_RF_Processing}.
	%\item[BDP-Heavy] \RF Processing, \S~\ref{loc:BDP-Heavy_RF_Processing}.
\end{description}

Under each of these segments the \ThisSys \RF Processing capabilities are further subdivided into the supported broadcasting bands as needed:

\begin{description}
	\item[\AM]        provides the \AM        broadcast output and related \RF processing.%, \S~\ref{loc:RF_Processing_AM}.
	\item[\SW]        provides the \SW        broadcast output and related \RF processing.%, \S~\ref{loc:RF_Processing_SW}.
	\item[\FM]        provides the \FM        broadcast output and related \RF processing.%, \S~\ref{loc:RF_Processing_FM}.
	\item[\TVVHFLow]  provides the \TVVHFLow  broadcast output and related \RF processing.%, \S~\ref{loc:RF_Processing_TVVHFLow}.
	\item[\TVVHFHigh] provides the \TVVHFHigh broadcast output and related \RF processing.%, \S~\ref{loc:RF_Processing_TVVHFHigh}.
	\item[\TVUHF]     provides the \TVUHF     broadcast output and related \RF processing.%, \S~\ref{loc:RF_Processing_TVUHF}.
	%\item[\CellLow]   provides the low-band cellular  \RF processing.%, \S~\ref{loc:RF_Processing_CellLow}.
	%\item[\CellHigh]  provides the high-band cellular \RF processing.%, \S~\ref{loc:RF_Processing_CellHigh}.
